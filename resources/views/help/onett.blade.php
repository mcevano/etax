                    <p>This return shall be filed in triplicate by any person, natural or juridical, resident or
                    non-resident, who transfers or causes to transfer property by gift, whether in trust or
                    otherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect and whether the property is real or personal,
                    tangible or intangible.
                    </p>
                    <dt>When and Where to File</dt>
                    <p>The return shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the date the gift (donation) is
                    made.
                    </p>
                    <p>The return shall be filed with any Authorized Agent Bank (AAB) of the Revenue
                    District Office having jurisdiction over the place of domicile of the donor at the time of the
                    transfer, or if there be no legal residence in the Philippines, with the Office of the
                    Commissioner, (Revenue District Office No. 39, South Quezon City) or with the Philippine
                    Embassy or Consulate in the country where he is domiciled at the time of the transfer. In
                    places where there are no Authorized Agent Banks, the return shall be filed with the
                    Revenue Collection Officer, or duly Authorized City or Municipal Treasurer of the Revenue
                    District Office having jurisdiction over the place of domicile of the donor.
                    </p>
                    <p>A separate return shall be filed by each donor for each gift (donation) made on
                    different dates during the year reflecting therein any previous net gifts made in the same
                    calendar year. Only one return shall be filed for several gifts (donations) by a donor to the
                    different donees on the same date.</p>
                    <p>If the gift (donation) involves conjugal/community property, each spouse shall file
                    separate return corresponding to his/her respective share in the conjugal/community
                    property. This rule shall likewise apply in the case of co-ownership over the property being
                    donated.
                    </p>
                    <dt>When and Where to Pay</dt>
                    <p>Upon filing this return, the total amount payable shall be paid to the Authorized
                    Agent Bank (AAB) where the return is filed. In places where there are no AABs, payments
                    shall be made directly to the Revenue Collection Officer or duly Authorized City or
                    Municipal Treasurer who shall issue a Revenue Official Receipt (ROR) therefor. Returns
                    filed with the Philippine Embassy or consulate shall be paid thereat</p>
                    <p>Where the returned is filed with an AAB, the lower portion of the return must be duly
                    machine-validated and stamped received by the Authorized Agent Bank to serve as receipt
                    of payment. The machine validation shall reflect the amount paid, the date of payment and
                    the transaction code and the stamp mark shall also show the name of the bank, branch code,
                    teller’s code and teller’s initial. The AAB shall also issue an official receipt or bank debit
                    advice or credit document, whichever is applicable, as additional proof of payment.</p>
                    <dt>Tax Rate and Basis of Tax</dt>
                    <p>In general, the tax due for gifts made to relatives shall be computed using the
                    schedular rates. If there is only one (1) gift given during the calendar year, the tax due shall
                    be based on the value of the gift donated less allowable deductions. However, if there are
                    several gifts made, the tax due shall be computed based on the total net gifts made during
                    the calendar year.</p>
                    <p>When the donee or beneficiary is a stranger, the tax payable by the donor shall be
                    thirty percent (30%) of the net gifts. For the purpose of this tax, a “stranger” is a person
                    who is not a: (1) brother, sister (whether by whole or half blood), spouse, ancestor and lineal
                    descendants; or (2) relative by consanguinity in the collateral line within the fourth degree
                    of relationship.
                    </p>
                    <dt>Valuation of gifts made in property</dt>
                    <p>If the gift is made in property, the fair market value thereof at the time of the
                    donation shall be considered the amount of the gift. In case of real property, the fair market
                    value as determined by the Commissioner or the fair market value as shown in the schedule</p>

                    <dt>Penalties</dt>
