                    An individual shall be allowed an additional exemption
                    of P25,000 for each qualified dependent child, but not
                    exceeding four (4). The additional exemption for
                    dependents shall be claimed by the husband, who is deemed
                    the proper claimant unless he explicitly waives his right in
                    favor of his wife. In the case of legally separated spouses,
                    additional exemption may be claimed only by the spouse
                    who has custody of the child or children; Provided, that the
                    total amount of additional exemptions that may be claimed
                    by both shall not exceed the maximum additional exemption
                    allowed by the Tax Code.

                    <strong>“Qualified Dependent Child”</strong> means a legitimate,

                        The return shall be filed within 15 days after the close of the
                    year immediately succeeding taxpayer’s covered taxable year.
                    Example: For calendar year 2000, the IAET return shall be filed on or
                    before January 15, 2002. This return shall be filed with any Authorized
                    Agent Bank (AAB) located within the territorial jurisdiction of the
                    Revenue District Office where the taxpayer’s place of business is

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In places where there are no AABs, the return shall be filed
                    with the Revenue Collection Officer or Duly Authorized City or
                    Municipal Treasurer of the municipality or city under the jurisdiction of
                    the Revenue District Office where the taxpayer’s principal place of
                    business is located and registered.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the taxpayer is a large taxpayer, the return shall be filed
                    with the AAB located at the BIR National Office except if said taxpayer
                    is under the jurisdiction of a Large Taxpayer District Office, (LTDO), in
                    which case the return shall be filed with the LTDO having jurisdiction
                    over the taxpayer.
                    </p>

                    <dt>When and Where to Pay</dt>

                    <p>
                        Upon filing this return, the total amount payable shall be paid
                    in full to the AAB where the return is filed. In places where there are no
                    AABs, payment shall be made directly to the Revenue Collection
                    Officer or duly Authorized City or Municipal Treasurer who shall issue

                    <p>
                        Where the return is filed with an AAB, the lower portion
                    must be duly machine validated and stamped received to serve as
                    receipt of payment. The machine validation shall reflect the amount

                    mark shall show the name of the AAB, branch code, teller’s code and

Any excess of the MCIT over the normal income tax shall be carried forward and credited against the normal income tax for the three (3) immediate succeeding taxable years.  </p>
                    <p>The computation and the payment of MCIT shall apply each time a corporate income tax return is filed, whether quarterly or annual basis. </p>
